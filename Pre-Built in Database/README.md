1. **Pre-Built Database 🏗️**

This section contains a **pre-built database** that you can **copy-paste** or **import** directly into your SQL environment. You can skip the database creation process and focus on querying the data right away!

Steps to Use Pre-Built Database:
1. **Copy and Paste 📋**:
   - Open your SQL editor or tool (such as MySQL Workbench, SQL Server Management Studio, or any other SQL client).
   - Copy the SQL scripts from the `Pre-Built` folder.
   - Paste the scripts into your SQL editor and run them to create the database and populate the tables with data.
   
2. **Import 📥**:
   - If you prefer to import the database file (e.g., `.sql` file), you can simply import the pre-built database into your SQL environment.
   - Use the `import` function available in your SQL client (e.g., in MySQL Workbench, use `File` > `Open SQL Script` or `File` > `Run SQL Script`).
