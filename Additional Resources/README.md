## Introduction to SQL üéì

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard programming language used for managing and manipulating relational databases. It is essential for interacting with databases, from creating tables to querying data.

### Why Learn SQL? ü§î
- SQL is used by most modern relational database management systems (RDBMS).
- It allows for the creation, modification, and management of databases.
- It is an essential skill for data analysis, data engineering, and software development.

## SQL Commands üìù

SQL commands are divided into several categories based on their function. Below are the main categories and a description of each.

### Data Definition Language (DDL) üî®

DDL commands are used to define or modify database structures such as tables, indexes, and schemas.

- **CREATE**: Creates a new database or table.
  ```sql
  CREATE TABLE Students (
      StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY,
      FirstName VARCHAR(50),
      LastName VARCHAR(50),
      Age INT
  );
  ```

- **ALTER**: Modifies an existing database object, like adding or dropping a column.
  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE Students ADD Email VARCHAR(100);
  ```

- **DROP**: Deletes a table or database.
  ```sql
  DROP TABLE Students;
  ```

- **TRUNCATE**: Removes all rows from a table without deleting the table itself.
  ```sql
  TRUNCATE TABLE Students;
  ```

- **RENAME**: Renames a table or database.
  ```sql
  RENAME TABLE Students TO Alumni;
  ```

### Data Manipulation Language (DML) üîß

DML commands are used to manipulate data within existing tables.

- **SELECT**: Retrieves data from a table.
  ```sql
  SELECT FirstName, LastName FROM Students;
  ```

- **INSERT**: Adds new rows of data to a table.
  ```sql
  INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, FirstName, LastName, Age)
  VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 20);
  ```

- **UPDATE**: Modifies existing data.
  ```sql
  UPDATE Students SET Age = 21 WHERE StudentID = 1;
  ```

- **DELETE**: Removes rows from a table.
  ```sql
  DELETE FROM Students WHERE StudentID = 1;
  ```

### Data Control Language (DCL) üîê

DCL commands are used to control access to data in the database.

- **GRANT**: Provides privileges to users.
  ```sql
  GRANT SELECT ON Students TO User1;
  ```

- **REVOKE**: Removes privileges from users.
  ```sql
  REVOKE SELECT ON Students FROM User1;
  ```

### Transaction Control Language (TCL) üîÑ

TCL commands are used to manage transactions within a database.

- **COMMIT**: Saves all changes made in the transaction.
  ```sql
  COMMIT;
  ```

- **ROLLBACK**: Undoes changes made during the transaction.
  ```sql
  ROLLBACK;
  ```

- **SAVEPOINT**: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can roll back.
  ```sql
  SAVEPOINT SavePoint1;
  ```

### SQL Clauses and Operators ‚öôÔ∏è

SQL commands are often combined with various clauses and operators to filter, sort, or group data.

- **WHERE**: Filters records based on a specified condition.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age > 21;
  ```

- **AND / OR**: Combines multiple conditions.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age > 21 AND FirstName = 'Jane';
  ```

- **BETWEEN**: Filters results within a range.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age BETWEEN 20 AND 25;
  ```

- **LIKE**: Searches for a specified pattern.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Students WHERE FirstName LIKE 'J%';
  ```

- **IN**: Matches one of several possible values.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age IN (20, 22, 25);
  ```

- **IS NULL**: Filters records where the value is NULL.
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Email IS NULL;
  ```

### SQL Joins üîó

SQL Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on related columns.

- **INNER JOIN**: Returns records that have matching values in both tables.
  ```sql
  SELECT Students.FirstName, Orders.OrderDate
  FROM Students
  INNER JOIN Orders
  ON Students.StudentID = Orders.StudentID;
  ```

- **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all records from the left table, along with matching records from the right table.
  ```sql
  SELECT Students.FirstName, Orders.OrderDate
  FROM Students
  LEFT JOIN Orders
  ON Students.StudentID = Orders.StudentID;
  ```

- **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)**: Returns all records from the right table, along with matching records from the left table.
  ```sql
  SELECT Students.FirstName, Orders.OrderDate
  FROM Students
  RIGHT JOIN Orders
  ON Students.StudentID = Orders.StudentID;
  ```

- **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN)**: Returns records when there is a match in one of the tables.
  ```sql
  SELECT Students.FirstName, Orders.OrderDate
  FROM Students
  FULL OUTER JOIN Orders
  ON Students.StudentID = Orders.StudentID;
  ```

- **SELF JOIN**: Joins a table with itself.
  ```sql
  SELECT A.FirstName AS 'Student1', B.FirstName AS 'Student2'
  FROM Students A, Students B
  WHERE A.StudentID <> B.StudentID;
  ```

### SQL Grouping and Sorting üé≤

SQL allows you to group and sort data using various clauses and functions.

- **GROUP BY**: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
  ```sql
  SELECT Age, COUNT(*)
  FROM Students
  GROUP BY Age;
  ```

- **HAVING**: Filters groups based on a condition (used with GROUP BY).
  ```sql
  SELECT Age, COUNT(*)
  FROM Students
  GROUP BY Age
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
  ```

- **ORDER BY**: Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order.
  ```sql
  SELECT FirstName, LastName, Age
  FROM Students
  ORDER BY Age DESC;
  ```

- **DISTINCT**: Removes duplicate rows from the result set.
  ```sql
  SELECT DISTINCT Age
  FROM Students;
  ```
